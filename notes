qsd/runs/duffing_fiducial
  src - trajectory function "traject_fiducial"
    rolls a single trajectory
    saves a parameter file and saves state at designated points in time
  noise from ACG seed in the state file  

duffing_gic
  generalized initial condition
  load arbitrary state
  described by density matrix?

  read saved state
  produces additional state files
  also produces an x.out
  
runs/LyapExp
1 peturbed trajectory from each of the duffing_fiducial state

DYNAMICS
Systems
Obey stochastic diffeq
  Consider stochastic element small -- use ODEs
  Small perturbation in X obeys a linear ODE
  (delta x)^2 perturbation in x negligible
  For short times, effectively a linear diffeq for dx and dp
  2 linear diffeqs with constant coefficients at any point in x and p
    2 real, 2 complex conj, or 1 real duplicated
    Simple average of eigenvalues across all system(x,p,t)
    For complex eigenvalues, are we interested in just the exp. multiplier?

Will we see limit cycles?
analyzer_lyapexp.py finds sqrt(delta_x^2 + delta_p^2)
